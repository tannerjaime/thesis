### [Project Plan]
Project plan for the coming weeks :

    -Continue to parse the GBIF API until I have all seed species. So far this has proven difficult as there are many subspecies using the name of a species, and so resolving this issue is my first priority
    
    -Take the scientific name and query the Nature API. Tried this with the species name but it was not specific enough, and would often bring up authors last names and other unrelated content. Take both the number of mentions and the articles that are being mentioned. 
    
    -Experiemnt with ways that every species can be shown individually. 
    
    -Do prelimary prints just to see what the range of article counts are. Select 5 number ranges that make sense from this step. 
    
    -Organize species into 5 categories
    
    -Initially randomly place, and be able to scroll over and get article information. then potentially organize by taxonomy
