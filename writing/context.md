2.1 Svalbard Seed Bank

As of 2006, about six million seed samples have been stored in about 1,300 gene banks throughout the world (Rajasekharan, 2015, p.1). Local seed diversity has long been protected and preserved through community seed banks, which may take the form of families or community groups gathering and storing seeds which represent the local habitat and are best adapted to withstand native pests, soil composition, diseases and climatic variations. Recently, these banks have also begun to take the form of large global repositories, such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which holds samples from around the world in underground chambers within a thick layer of permafrost and rock (Van â€˜t Wout et al., 2014, p.1-7). Global seed banks offer the opportunity to create secure backups of local seed repositories from the around the world, and can sometimes provide benefits that may not be available to smaller community seed banks, such as technical expertise, sophisticated storage facilities, and assistance in monitoring viability and regenerating materials when needed (Fowler, 2008).
