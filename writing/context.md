1. Archiving Nature

	While the concept of biodiversity is in no way new, the term arose as an area of political and scientific concern in the 1980s (**cite Rafi Youatt pg. 27). This focus on variability within and between species and ecosystems came out of a period where so much of this variance was declining. Plant species in particular have diminished as habitat destruction has increased. Industrial agriculture’s reliance on pesticides and practices of monocropping have resulted in an erosion of crop genetic diversity (Shiva, 2015).

	With a crisis as encompassing as the biodiversity crisis, steps towards species and habitat protection are considerable measures. In the 1980’s, conservation efforts focused on preserving biodiversity hotspots - regions of very high species and habitat variance and areas of most concern. Over the next decade, conservation trends drifted away from preserving the hotspot as a whole towards efforts to deconstruct this abstraction. Science and policy shifted towards understanding the species and their roles within an ecosystem, as well as understanding how these species could be of benefit to us. In the 1990s, a global census of biodiversity was started with the hopes of taking an inventory of all the earth’s species and determining areas of greatest conservation needs (Youatt, 2015, pg. 25-47). 
	
	In his book “Counting Species”, Rafi Youatt writes of the Foucauldian concept of biopower. This concept, which concerns the ways in which power operate on living bodies themselves, applies well to the concept of the biodiversity census. In allowing our self-constructed classification of the earth’s species to guide our conservation efforts, we are exercising a form of control that limits the life and death of species or habitat to the human subjects responsible for the counting and categorizing. While on one hand the exertion of this power over nonhuman species may be the only way in which humans can evaluate and manage our impact, biotic life does not self-regulate in the same way. While this exclusion from self-regulation may mean that nonhuman life suffers from the constraints that we place, Youatt argues that this does not remove these organisms from this framework of biopower. In fact, they play a role in the self-regulation of humans, as evidenced by our government’s responses to invasive species, resistant bug strains, and organisms that are vectors for infectious pathogens (2015). 
	
	This argument raises questions over our museological approach to preserving plant biodiversity. In exerting this control over deciding which plant species to preserve, do we remove the agency of nonhumans to resist our normalizing forces? The ways in which biopower is retained by biotic organisms differs from that of humans. Nonhumans, Youatt writes, rely on “their own semiotic interpretations of the environment and act accordingly...through migrating, reproducing,consuming resources, and filling ecological niches in unexpected ways” (2015, p.48). Controlling and, arguably, suppressing the ability of nonhumans to govern these behaviors forces a paradigm of control over a body that is constitutionally resistant to it. Without maintaining a balance of biopower between human and nonhuman species, conserving the state of biodiversity as it exists today will prove unattainable. In balancing our efforts to a more holistic understanding of our environment, one that can empower
