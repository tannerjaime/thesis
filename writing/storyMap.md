### Why Do I Want To Read This?

The Introduction of this thesis works to engage the reader by beginning with the ultimate goals and questions that this paper hopes to address â€“ how effective are the tools that we presently have in place to ensure food security. The introduction will then walk the reader from this topic at a 1000 foot view to understanding the specifics of why a comparison of the growth conditions of each individual species represented within one seed bank is such a valuable analysis. It will do so by first outlining the importance that biodiversity plays in food security, outlining current attempts to address the issue of genetic drift, and explain the current system of analysis in place. 

### What Will I Learn?

The Background and Treatment section will outline how the reader will learn not only about the seed bank covered in this examination and about current attempts of examining biodiversity, but will also attempt to answer our initial question. This will be powerful, as the reader will not simply have this information explained, but will have the opportunity to explore the data themselves, and reach their own conclusions about the current state of seed repositories. 

### Where Are We Going Next? 

As the reader reaches the end of this thesis, and with a working knowledge of some of the topics discussed, we can begin to see the importance of these banks and examine this topic from a more geopolitical standpoint. At this point, some basic analysis of the seed donors and contributors will be done, as well as an analysis of the diversity of the contributions from these donors, and this will lead to a final discussion of future steps for these banks and contributors alike.
