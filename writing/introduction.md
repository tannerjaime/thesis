1 Introduction

We are currently in what many are considering the 6th great extinction of animal and plant species on our planet. In such instances of loss or of temporal change, one of the more traditional reactionary behaviors that humans have is to preserve - to collect and to store. Plant biology seems to lend itself to our practices of preservation, encasing the embryonic plant in a protective covering and allowing it to remain dormant for long periods of time, until ideal environmental conditions are met. Seed storing is a practice as old as agriculture itself, but the extensive loss of species and diversity over the last 100 years have ushered the way for larger scale seed banks. Considered to be a place of safe storage for the duplicates of many of the rare, critical or disappearing plant species of the world, some of our global seed banks are beginning to be seen as an archive of our earth’s biodiversity. 

What is lost in our pursuit to collect, document and store nature? Our archival practices are limited by our capacities, our questioning, our commitment to the task and the constraints of our data structures (Waterton & Wynne, 2013, p. 127). In our practice of preservation it is critical to not only categorize what we can and have collected, but to recognize that which is excluded. The very idea of “preserving” or “conserving” species seems paradoxical - holding organisms suspended in time as a means of protecting a system that is so dependant on heterogeneity, dynamism and change (**Cite geof barker pg 110). The danger of archival practices may come in the form of a shift in focus from an approach that acknowledges the role and necessity of the ecosystem to this museological approach. In their chapter entitled “Archiving Biodiversity”, Waterton and Wynne write that “archiving biodiversity, is a risky, double-edged business, which may perversely inflate the likelihood and magnitude of further loss, while we think it is assisting protection” (2013). 

The pages that follow describe a visual exploration of the contents of one seed bank and an inquiry into the more granular trends of its constituents. Using photographs of the seeds collected in the Svalbard Seed Bank- representing both the most diverse seed bank in the world and one that is built for the most long-term storage- this paper will describe the process of visualizing the contents of this bank, the process of visualizing trends from this organism-directed position, and the use of these images to evaluate some of the current practices of distinction and characterization.
