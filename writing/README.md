### [1. Introduction](https://github.com/tannerjaime/thesis/blob/master/writing/introduction.md)
    1.1 Motivation
        Our vulnerability due to genetic drift and monocultures
        Why evaluating diversity is difficult, how this visual will attempt to address this
    1.2 ex situ Plant Conservation
        1.2.1 Intentions and Objectives of Seed Banks
        1.2.2 An Overview of Current Global Effort
    1.3 Challenges
        1.3.1 Quantity and Diversity of Archival Sites
        1.3.2 Quantity and Diversity of Seeds Deposited
        1.3.3 Control of Depositors 
    1.4 Approach
        Thesis outlines a process for representing the diversity within one seed bank and investigating how rich a representation of the planetâ€™s plant biodiversity these archives provide.
### [2. Data & Context](https://github.com/tannerjaime/thesis/blob/master/writing/context.md)
    2.1 Svalbard Global Seed Bank
        Description of the facility
            Origin
            Goals
            Terms of Use
    2.2 Analyzing Biodiversity Through Species Characteristics
        Why was this approach chosen? Why not comparative genetics approach? 
        What ware the stregnths of evaluation based on crop growth conditions and functionality 
        Discuss precedence  
    2.3 Global Effort
	    Countries that have contributed
	    What are some of the conditions of these contributions?
	    Challenges in obtaining deposits
        Withdrawals 
	        Recent Syrian Withdrawal
	        Seed redistribution 
### 3. Treatment
    3.1 Data
        3.1.1 Svalbard Global Seed Bank Database
        3.1.2 USDA PLANTS Database
        3.1.3 Global Biodiversity Information Facility
       [Ideal Data Structure](https://github.com/tannerjaime/thesis/blob/master/writing/sampleDataStructure.js)
    3.2 Examining Diversity 
        3.2.1 Examining Diversity Within Species
        3.2.2 Comparing Characteristics
    3.3 Donor Analysis
        3.3.1 Contributions By Country
        3.3.2 Comparing Contributions by Diversity
### 4. Results
    4.1 Diversity
        What does this visualization make clear about the diversity in current collection? 
        What species characteristics seemed less represented within the visualization
        General findings regarding diversity within the collection
    4.2 Bank Contributors 
        Is there a relationship between the biodiversity and the country depositing? 
        Is the country depositing most maintaining more threatened species? 
        Are there global regions where efforts should be focused in order to secure valuable species? 
### 5. Discussion
    Revisiting Initial Questions 
    Evaluation of Methodology Used
    Future Directions
